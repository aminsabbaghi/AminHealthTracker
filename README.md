This project is a simple hospital management system built in Java. It helps organize and manage information about patients, doctors, and their medical records. You can create patient profiles with details like their name, age, gender, and a unique ID. Each patient can also have a medical history that includes their diagnosis and treatment. Doctor profiles are created as well, containing details like name, age, gender, ID, and their area of expertise. Doctors can be assigned to patients based on their specialization, which makes the process of matching doctors to the right patients easier.

The hospital class is the main part of the system, where it stores lists of patients and doctors. It allows you to add new patients and doctors, making sure there are no duplicates in the system. Doctors can also be assigned to patients, and each patientâ€™s medical history is tracked, storing details of their diagnoses and treatments. Overall, this project is a helpful tool for managing hospital information, making things more organized and efficient.
